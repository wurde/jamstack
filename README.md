Pre-rendered web applications deployed via static asset host, CDN, and DNS.

This technology stack is [J]avascript, [A]PIs, and [M]arkdown. It delivers a better experience for both developer and customer.  Deployment is an easy upload of pre-rendered assets to a static asset host. Distribution of those assets via a CDN means lowest latency and highest resiliency. Most of the setup work will be in configuring your domain via DNS.
